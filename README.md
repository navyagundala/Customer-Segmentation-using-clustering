Customer Segmentation using clustering
Customer segmentation using clustering is an analytical technique that divides a company’s customer base into distinct groups with similar characteristics, behaviors, or preferences. It helps businesses understand their customers more deeply and design targeted marketing strategies. The process typically begins with data collection from various sources such as sales records, social networks, or surveys, including demographic, behavioral, and social attributes. This data is then preprocessed through cleaning, normalization, and sometimes dimensionality reduction using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to prepare it for clustering. Clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN are then applied to group customers based on feature similarities. The performance of these clusters is evaluated using metrics like the Silhouette Score, Davies–Bouldin Index, or within-cluster sum of squares (inertia) to ensure meaningful and distinct segments. Once identified, each cluster is analyzed to interpret customer profiles, such as high-value buyers, loyal customers, or price-sensitive groups. These insights enable businesses to personalize marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability. In essence, customer segmentation using clustering transforms raw customer data into actionable intelligence, allowing organizations to make data-driven decisions and develop more effective customer relationship management strategies.
